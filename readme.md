# Locksafe

losing your precious slippers at the Delhi Bangla Sahib Gurudwara is no foreign concept to Sikh Delhites. 
we, at Syntax were assigned the task of bringing to life "Locksafe", a decentralized technology-based locker system.  

Locksafe allows you to select and purchase a locker for your footwear & store it safely, until your visit is over. 
once your visit is over, you can authenticate into your locker with the help of an access key.
this ensures the safety of your footwear & streamlines your visiting experience.
